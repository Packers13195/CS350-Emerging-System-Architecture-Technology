Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I developed a smart thermostat using the raspberry pi. Connecting buttons, LEDs, LCD screen, and a Temperature/Humidity sensor were the components used for the thermostat. 
The thermostat runs using the python screen to control the buttons, LED lights, and LCD screen. 
A smart thermostat helps make heating and cooling more efficient than a regular thermostat

What did you do particularly well?
I think I was able to put the components together on the breadboard and didnt have any issues throughout the course. I had no experience using a raspberry pi until this class and I think I did well with it.

Where could you improve?
I can definitely improve my programming abilities. I continue to practice with my rasberry pi and try to develop other devices or improve my thermostat.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Python documentation and raspberry pi documentation are resources I will use

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The programming skills with python will be transferrable to other projects and course work. This is a very useful skill and I will have to continue to practice and use it to continue to learn and improve.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The python code is readable with the comments and the spacing.
There are methods that could be reused by other components if needed
This also makes this maintainable
The hardware is also changable by swapping buttons around and LED lights.
